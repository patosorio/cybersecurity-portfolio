# Cybersecurity Portfolio

Documenting my journey in hands-on labs, Python automation scripts and detailed reports. 

## About this Portfolio

My study plan involves completing Try Hack Me rooms, CyberDefender Path Rooms, a Hack the Box challenge a day and 3 labs per week, each with:

- A 500-word write-up detailing the lab process, findings, and tools used.
- A Python script to automate analysis (parsing netwrok traffic, auditing logs...)
- A formal report (e.g., forensic summary, incident report) to document findings for professional communication.
- Blog snapshots, reports to share progress and insights. 

### General Goals

My overarching goal is to study cybersecurity different areas, capable of analyzing digital evidence, identifying threats, and automating investigative processes. Through this study plan, I aim to:

- Master practical cybersecurity skills for real-word investigations.
- Develop automation tools using Python to streamline analysis
- Build a professional portfolio to demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers in the cybersecurity field. 

### Skills I'll Be Studying

This study plan covers a wide range of cybersecurity skills, including but not limited to:

- **Network Traffic Analysis**: Capturing and analyzing packets (e.g., using Wireshark, Scapy) to identify suspicious activity.
- **Log Auditing**: Parsing and auditing logs (e.g., system logs, application logs) to detect anomalies or breaches.
- **File Recovery Forensics**: Recovering deleted or hidden files using tools like Autopsy.
- **Memory Forensics**: Analyzing memory dumps (e.g., with Volatility) to uncover malicious processes or artifacts.
- **Subnet Traffic Analysis**: Investigating traffic within subnets to identify unauthorized access.
- **Service Permissions Audit**: Auditing service configurations for security vulnerabilities.
- **Incident Response**: Developing workflows to respond to security incidents.
- **Threat Hunting**: Proactively searching for threats in network and system data.
- **Malware Analysis**: Examining malware behavior using static and dynamic analysis techniques.
- **Python Automation**: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks in investigations (e.g., parsing PCAP files, extracting log data).

## Repository Structure

- `labs/`: Lab write-ups in Markdown format (500 words each).
  - Example: `labs/2025-04-21-packet-capture.md` (Lab 1: Network Traffic Capture).
- `scripts/`: Python scripts for lab automation and tools.
  - Example: `2025-04-21-ftp-parser.py` (Lab 1 script to parse FTP commands).
- `reports/`: Formal cybersecurity reports summarizing investigations, findings, and recommendations.
  - Example: `reports/2025-04-24-forensic-summary.md`(Lab 3: Forensic Analysis Summary).

## Study Plan Progress

This portfolio follows a long-term study plan starting April 21, 2025, with 3 labs per week. Below is the progress, with Weeks 1-2 detailed and placeholders for future weeks.

### Week 1
