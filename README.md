## About this Portfolio

My study plan involves completing hands-on platforms (TryHackMe, CyberDefenders, Hack The Box) and structured labs, with the goal of building a professional portfolio for cybersecurity analyst, forensic investigator, or penetration tester roles.

- A 500-word write-up detailing the lab process, findings, and tools used.
- A Python script to automate analysis (parsing network traffic, auditing logs...)
- A formal report (e.g., forensic summary, incident report) to document findings for professional communication.
- Blog snapshots, reports to share progress and insights. 

### General Goals

My overarching goal is to study cybersecurity different areas, with the goal of becoming capable of analyzing digital evidence, identifying threats, and automating investigative processes., identifying threats, and automating investigative processes. Through this study plan, I aim to:

- Master practical cybersecurity skills for real-word investigations.
- Develop automation tools using Python to streamline analysis
- Build a professional portfolio to demonstrate my capabilities to potential employers in the cybersecurity field. 

### Skills I'll Be Studying

This study plan covers a wide range of cybersecurity skills, including but not limited to:

1. **Network Traffic Analysis**: Capturing and analyzing packets (e.g., using Wireshark, Scapy) to identify suspicious activity.
2. **Subnet Traffic Analysis**: Investigating traffic within subnets to identify unauthorized access.
3. **Log Auditing**: Parsing and auditing logs (e.g., system logs, application logs) to detect anomalies or breaches.
4. **Python Automation**: Writing scripts to automate repetitive tasks in investigations (e.g., parsing PCAP files, extracting log data).
5. **Malware Analysis**: Examining malware behavior using static and dynamic analysis techniques.
6. **Incident Response**: Developing workflows to respond to security incidents.
7. **Threat Hunting**: Proactively searching for threats in network and system data.
8. **File Recovery Forensics**: Recovering deleted or hidden files using tools like Autopsy.
9. **Memory Forensics**: Analyzing memory dumps (e.g., with Volatility) to uncover malicious processes or artifacts.
10. **Windows Forensics**: Analyzing event logs, registry hives, NTFS timestamps.
11. **Active Directory Security**: Performing AD enumeration, Pass-the-Hash attacks, BloodHound analysis, and hardening techniques.
12. **Web Application Security**: Testing OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities using Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, SQLi, XSS exploitation.
13. **Service Permissions Audit**: Auditing service configurations for security vulnerabilities.
14. **SIEM & Detection Engineering**: Practicing Splunk queries, writing detection rules, performing basic threat hunting.
15. **Certification Preparation**: eJPT and PNPT practice labs, mock exams, and CTF participation.
